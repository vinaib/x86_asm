X86 supports 5 modes
---------------------
Real Mode (16 bit)
Protected Mode (16 and 32 bit)
Long Mode (64 bit)
Virtual 86 Mode (16 bit)
System Management Mode (16 bit)

	 A 16-bit subset of instructions are available on the 16-bit x86 processors,
	 which are the 8086, 8088, 80186, 80188, and 80286. These instructions are
	 available in real mode on all x86 processors, 
	 
	 and in 16-bit protected mode (80286 onwards)Additional instructions
	 relating to protected mode are available.

	 On the 80386 and later, 32-bit instructions (including later extensions)
	are also available in all modes, including real mode; on these CPUs, V86
	mode and 32-bit protected mode are added, with additional instructions
	provided in these modes to manage their features.

	Finally, in long mode, 64-bit instructions, and more registers, are also
	available.
