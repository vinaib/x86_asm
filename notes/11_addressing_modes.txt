--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Real-Address Mode:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Only 1MB of memory can be addressed(20 bit Address bus)
-> from 00000 to FFFFF
-> processor can run only one program at a time
-> Application programs can access any memory location
-> 20 bit address cannot fit into 16bit registers. So segment and offset
   mechanism is introduced by intel engineers.
-> to represent 20 bit address, two 16 bit registers are used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Protected Mode:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> processor can run multiple programs at a time
-> each running program is assigned 4GB of memory (0x0000 0000 to 0xffff ffff)
-> programs cannot access each others code and data
-> segments refer to segment descriptor table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Virtual-8086 Mode:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> processor runs in protected mode and creates a virtual 8086 machine with its
   own 1MB addresss sapce which runs in real address mode

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Segments:   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> All of the memory is divied into 64kB of segments(0x0000 - 0xffff)
-> to represent 20 bit address, two 16 bit registers are used
# first 16 bit register for segment. For this one of the segment registers will
# be used i.e. 	
		a) Code segment
  		b) data segment
		c) stack segment
		d) extra segment
		e) fs
		f) gs
# second register for offset

Example: segment - offset address: (08F1 : 0100)
Adjusted segment value: (08F1 * 0100) = 08F10h (actual value is (0x08f100)
		adjusted to 20 bits(0x08f10)
-> these segment registers holds the base address of running program
